## a distributed key-value store system
This is an implementation of a distributed key value store system. When a `put` request is generated by the `client`, `server` will generate a randomised algorithm to decide which node to store the data in. 

After the target `node` is decided, `server` will send both `key` and `value` to the `node` and expect to get a `successful` response. 

The `get` request works in a similar way. The algorithm implementation ensures that for each unique `key`, the target `node` remains the same.

## Set up server, node, and client

0. `$ make`
1. First bring the `node` online since it's where all the data is supposed to be by `./node`
2. Then bring `server` online by putting how many nodes are available and their ip addressed, for example `$ ./server 1 localhost:3345`
3. Then the `client` could test using `./client localhost:3344 put key value`, note that the `localhost:3344` is the IP address of server
